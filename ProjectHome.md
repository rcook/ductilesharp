# Ductile# #

Ductile# is an extension to the Mono C# compiler that allows the developer to turn off most type checking within the compiler. Why would a developer want to do this? The goal is to allow developers to perform rapid prototyping and experimentation while temporarily bypassing the restrictions of the C# type system.

Ductile# is an implementation of [Ductile](Ductile.md)-style detyping transforms applied to the C# programming language just as [DuctileJ](DuctileJ.md) is an implementation for the Java programming language.
